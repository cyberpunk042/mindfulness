# Become the fluid(s)

> The more you can get yourself convinced, the more you can become it.
> 

Too redundant? I think not… Those are not lyrics but they might just be…

### Key Points

Be the Eye of observation.

BUT, aim to become the fluid.

To come to Be a Flowing mass.

A blob of energy. In and over it.

> Be liquid, like great Dads would say.
e.g. Rick and Morty s06e03 8:54-9:41
> 

### Constant awareness

Inner flow, outer shell and pressure.

The human and the Eye that channels.

Pressure transfered into the body. [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)

No more than can be handled for success.

> **You** learn to become one with it and thrive.
To the mind observing this, and processing.
> 
> 
> **Residing in the Gap**, in stillness and mindful.

### Conscious and Sub-concious

Two intertwined, **cardio-vascular** and nervous system.

One is the **inside**, the living and the other is the outside.

The latter can unlock meta-cognition and meta-**awareness**.

A world of fluctuations, possibilities and information motion.

Your **inner flow** and life and you mind-over/full flow being born.

The Dad part watching over your kid/living self, it can go so slow.

Slow this and you might just realize what time is, smooth and easy.

That is your subconcious, and growing as part of you. Englobing you.

Becoming one with your reality, leading to many new possible realities.

Those Alpha and Beta waves will lead your life. Learn to become the wave.

In stillness and mindfulness, you can return to being the waves, the fluid way.

Fail as many time as you want, the important is just getting up and trying again.

> Learn the Deep mind and put meaning and energy into those words and Flow. 
When you can convince yourself of this and bear the meaning of it.
Then you have taken a major step into your greater mind.

### You are just like a flow of energy, sum of flowing energies

**You are a fluid flowing** in a gaz world, but first flowing inside before outside.

Be 70 / 30 or 90 / 10, more in than out. More self than outter reality.
*Or even be 60 / 20 for at least 20 of space (fun?) in between. ;p*

The flowing inner (70) and the flowing outter (30) veils.

Comes down to how you can visualize in the present.

Be the sum of your liquid (mass), in full energy.

Tapping into your senses and subconcious.

Where problems meet solutions, friend.

### Don’t be fearful, be brave

9 billions of possible sensations at least.

Different type of reality… get to YOURs.

Dragging the Gap, Eye of observation.

Seing hard things, feeling hard things.

But use the way of the Tao, and let go.

A fortress in the mind, for a strong life.

### Careful to MIND traps

**When we fall into our traps.**

Those of the Mental or of **Flow**.. 
*Chaotic, disrupting, hurting, breaking..*

Leading you out of the flowing reality.
*Chasing, distracted, or even unhealthy..*

Draining you of your precious energy.

**STOP** and regain control of your mind.

DO NOT need anything but what is **in**.

[Pitfalls: My worse bugs](Pitfalls%20My%20worse%20bugs%20a6bad3327c7f4062a8734946557c17e8.md) 

You’re the source of your happiness.

Rethink your veil when necessary.
Pause and change perspective.

Observe light and **be smooth**.

**Body Fix (for the Mind)**

Don't break your fluid, heal it instead.

**Be kind** and observe with confidence.

Slow down, smoothen the **agitations**.

With **compationate** time & attention.

Return to **being the flow, fluid of self**.

### The Aim

**When any moment can become a flow moment. 
Well and potent and confident. Ready for it.**
