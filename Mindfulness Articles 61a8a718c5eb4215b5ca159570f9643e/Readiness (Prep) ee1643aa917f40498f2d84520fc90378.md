# Readiness (Prep)

in a given day, in a a given week, a given moment, there is a flow between two side inside yourself.

a flow preparation, a phasing with your mind from the asleep, idle or other state into this new one.

There is a moment when you are in the gap where you can have the handle on the energy range.

WIth a lose enough grip but still large enough. Thinking as if you mind was a spherical muscle. 3D.

A moment where you can be in complete awareness of your energy and possibly even the outside.

Mindfulness in its puress form… A time of mindspace observation, and or mind to body grounding.

You being the produce of something like a melody, 

you can write any symphony if you learn to do so

A symphony of process, of waves in a system.

Like muscles sending force down the medium.

An energy state that is oriented to the set “goal”.
You staying insinde that feeling, discomfort or not.

The more you stay in it the more you stay comfortable.
The more you can be confident and convinced if in peace.
