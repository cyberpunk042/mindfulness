# Gravity is the power of the mind

> It may be faint, it may be ‚Äúweak‚Äù but the power of attention of the mind is a form of gravity.
> 

Why so? Everything is built on energy and works through gravity and relativity of A to B to X.

The mind is no different, if reality such as the body is a machinery that needs to be put in motion through a force, this force is gravity, push and pull. It starts with observation and then gravitation.

Is it hard to accept? Hard to believe? That we have to rely on something we will never be able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù, but only perceive and have to trust our perception rather than deny or shy from it!?

üí° Here is a small parallel to physics and the bedrock that can be observed from within:
Everything is made of Muon and Gluon and ‚Ä¶ and those, electron, neutron, photon, etc.. are all of what we can call a sum of energy, a sum of energy in fluctuation, what is driving it ? Information, attraction, repulsion, pressure, inertia...
energy is made of Quarks, Up, Down, and charm, in constant exchange of information at an imperceptible pace / rate / frequency to / for us giving how dilated our experience is and so slow compared to the sleep of light / information travelling. Time A to B. Point A to B.

So it would not come as a surprise that our ability revolve around energy and information.
A structure gave room to this reality, to this universe and we must accept it.
The sooner we accept the sooner we can work with it and its structure.

Lets understand what gravity is.

An inside / center, a mass / weight and a sphere / bubble of gravitation. üßø
Within the gravitational field, room for connection and reception of energies
At the center a point of convergence?  A sum of the mass and flowing energy.

Understand this and you might understand many things in life, including you.

Why is this key? First understanding can lead to clarity and clarity to peace.

It is key because that is how observation works. We are as the mind the one that will give rise to and sustain our gravitationnal sphere that will power us and that will push or pull us our reality.
You can only use gravitation in the ways that are possible. Within your control. (Not mindless)
Using gravitation, the moving of your center of attention, the focal point of your observation, 
you will be able to move the window into the field, tuning in to the sense and feeling energy.
As you move you change the center of your broadcast, which is what the mind is ‚Äúseeing‚Äù or rather perceive I should say. Think of the blind monk, what does he see ? He doesn‚Äôt see, he senses.
This is what has been refered to as the power of the third eye, the cursor of attention.
Combining this power of focused attention to the ability to grow a sphere around.

Expending, like a stretch of concentration around the area of focus, then flow can rise.

> If you can not feel, hold ‚Äúsight‚Äù and let it flow, you have become the energy.
Never forget that as the observer you can detach, you do not need anything.
> 

What will have the impact of this expending and sustained field of observation? 
All. It leads to everything. Connection to cells, to organs, to bones, to systems.
It is an all access single entry point for the mind to what is possible. (senses)
Senses to receive through pull, and to have an impact / influence on push.

> See life like a blind man that is never pressured by the outer reality
Always in HIS field of observation. This way, mind drives. For real.
> 

It is not that you cannot accept the outside but no more than 30/70.
You will let people distract you but with time, mind takes more shapes.

Always throughout life you will have to remember this gravity though.
Otherwise, you might get, ill from agitation or stress and inflamation.
You might resorb by discontentment or feeling of too much hard.

> That‚Äôs fine, mindfulness will always await you.
> 

But remember it when you ask yourself what is Depression, What is Burnout, What is illness, What is not feeling well.

This may be your only way out of denial or over any challenge in general.

Mind will enveloppe you, through it‚Äôs power of flow and make you go foward.
Mindless ‚Üí Stagiant, Drifting or Backwward.

> Understanding Mindset, Happiness, and Motivation and traps, you will be more equiped.
> 

Mind will allow you to use muscles, to strech, neurons and muscle fibers through nerves.
It will allow you to feel your blood flow, diaphragm, heart rate and so much more.

WHY ?
Cuz you wanne see. You wannt see / feel if there isn‚Äôt any thing that does‚Äôt flow.
Fatigue, burnout, immunity, cancer‚Ä¶ You want to avoid that with mindfulness. 

Think of physical health / aging as damage.

Think of your aliveness as your spirit, your flow.

And mind just as the beggining, always in the now.

Mind can become one with spirit and flow can heal it.
The two have to work together and body to be respected.
This mean you have to be aware without losing track of mind.
Observe and feel the flow, become the spirit, alive / animated self.
But remain detach from energy / sensations / stress / push and pulls

Will the focal point remain in your body or will it be outside and you inside body?
Sure you want to move it if you want to look at Gut or Heart or Brain, but return.

Being anxious would mean being the victim of the flow of the Gut
Being excited would mean being the surfer of the flow of the Gut.
One is being pulled and the other is being pushed by a wave.
The wave might then be temporary or one might stick to it.
Sooner you can identify the bad wave and let go, better?
Let go of it or expend a new sphere with your gravity.
Flow is distracting you and you become less mindful.
The relative of your focus weight is not strong enough.
How do you fix it? Sense, of gravity, of energy. & belief.
You are the wave but before that the mind supplying it.
The more you calm the mind, the more you will calm you.
How do you do that ? Easier said than done. The famous GAP.

The stronger the core and the bigger the sphere, the more potential.
If you can keep it in check and keep it in flow, you have something.

This weight may hold between you and the now and don‚Äôt let go.
Refering to the anchor of the mind, center of gravity of the field.

You trully have your own field, and what this mean is immense.
This mean that you can become or achieve whatever is possible.

Gravity Articles ?

> Will it fucking stick is what he told himself so many time.. his holistic mindfulness.
Accepting this discomfort in gravity (sense) in the connection with reality. All of it.
He want to be strong and he want to be brave, he wants to hold on to it. Organs.
Inside the liquid (flow) inside the field (0bservation inside reality (energy in time)
> 

On that note is: How do you not hurt your Gut or Heart connection ? 
How do you heal the pressure ?  Mindful attention and will (flow).
Sustain gravity field, backend and frontend with brain and organs.

Find the strength to extend again and look and accept all senses.
Stay mindful, stay grounding, but integrate your senses of whole.
With love, kindness, compassion, whatever makes sense to put‚Ä¶
