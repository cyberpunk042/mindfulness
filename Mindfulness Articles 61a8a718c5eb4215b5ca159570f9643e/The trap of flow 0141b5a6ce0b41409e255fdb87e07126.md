# The trap of flow

Turning into Rush (front-forward) → fix toward back and returning to gravity(energy) center.
And acceptance of the sensation of energy and the current state and possible void or agitations.

### Phenomena?

Too strong oscillation that tiptoe/ tumble into reality or back into the void. (Losing feet / balance / awareness of center of gravity, gravitational sphere and the inner and outer of things / extremities of spectrum/ opposites on a scale or side of a geometry shape) → victim of reality or sensations or emotions and becoming a prisoner of the mind, a limited self version.

Master flow and master balance for a sustainable mastery of flow and live.

Only the mind, not without accepting and being / becoming the host of the mind.

Becoming the host for more potential and capacity and the mind for distance, rhythm and equilibrium? And navigating in hand.

A team. Be the Team

The Pause / Gap. Not just about the breath holds but about catching up with it during and after and the integration of the browser journey and new sum of senses gate and so into becoming of our energy in the now.!?
