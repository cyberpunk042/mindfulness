# Three main Superpowers

# Synopsis

## The Gut

No I am not talking about your “gut feelings”, I am talking about the Gut as an integrated organ / component with the mind.

## The Heart

No I am not talking about your heartrate, I am talking about your rhythm (/ heart rate variability) and coherence with the mind.

## The Brain(s)

No the brain is not the mind, it is just like the rest part of what adds up to the sum of what we call mind. No there isn’t a single brain but rather an interconnected web of different tools / capabilities.
