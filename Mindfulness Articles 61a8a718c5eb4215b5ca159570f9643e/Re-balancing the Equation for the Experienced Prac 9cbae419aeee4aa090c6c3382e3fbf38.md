# Re-balancing the Equation for the Experienced Practitioner

### **Advanced Attentional Training**

For those who regularly practice mindful flow, advanced attentional techniques can help fine-tune your focus. This could involve deepening your current mindfulness practices or incorporating new techniques like insight meditation to increase self-awareness.

### **Leveraging Past Successes**

In your case, you likely have several instances where you've successfully entered and maintained a flow state. Use these as mental bookmarks that you can refer back to when self-doubt starts to creep in. Reminding yourself of past successes can serve as an immediate counterbalance to doubt.

### **Adaptive Self-Coaching**

As an experienced practitioner, your self-coaching skills are probably well-honed. Use this to your advantage by adopting an adaptive strategy that continually refines your approach based on ongoing feedback from your emotional and cognitive states. This is akin to having a real-time, internal dialogue where you serve as both the coach and the coachee, making adjustments as needed.

### **Intentional Emotional Regulation**

Being proficient in mindful flow also means you're likely skilled at recognizing and managing your emotional states. When self-doubt occurs, leverage this skill to intentionally shift your emotional state back towards one that fosters flow.

### **Meta-Awareness**

At your level, simple awareness of self-doubt might not be enough to defuse it. Cultivating meta-awareness, an awareness of your awareness, can offer deeper insights into the root cause of the doubt and help you address it at a foundational level.

## **Conclusion for the Advanced Practitioner**

Maintaining a state of mindful flow is a dynamic process that even seasoned practitioners find challenging when confronted with self-doubt. However, your advanced skills offer you a unique set of tools for not only recognizing the onset of doubt but also for efficiently navigating back to a flow state. By leveraging your skills in attentional training, emotional regulation, and adaptive self-coaching, you can quickly recalibrate and return to optimal performance.
