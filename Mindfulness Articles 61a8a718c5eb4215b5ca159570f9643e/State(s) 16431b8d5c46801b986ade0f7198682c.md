### **1. Deep (Subconscious or Field of Being):**

- **Nature**: Represents the foundational state of being, where energy flows and electromagnetic fields resonate. This is the realm of deep rest, intuition, and unspoken truths.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Associated with the body's **subtle energy** or electromagnetic flow.
    - A state of profound focus and surrender, where actions are not forced but naturally unfold.
    - Connected to the nervous system's **parasympathetic state**, often tied to regeneration, grounding, and presence.
- **Purpose**: In the "Deep," you tap into the **core self** or essence, accessing a vast field of potential and wisdom that is beyond conscious reasoning.

### **2. Dream (Imagination and Intellect):**

- **Nature**: Represents the creative and intellectual state, often tied to the dream-like experiences during sleep or active imagination.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Serves as a bridge between the **Deep** and the **Wake**.
    - Where the intellect and subconscious interweave, creating scenarios and possibilities.
    - Associated with the body's **beta-theta brainwave states**, where creativity and visualization thrive.

### **3. Wake (Physical Reality):**

- **Nature**: The conscious, grounded state where you interact with the physical world. It is your **current reality** and the space where action happens.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Focused on the **here and now**—your bodily sensations, actions, and external environment.
    - Governed by conscious choice and awareness.
    - Associated with the body's **sympathetic nervous system** and survival mechanisms.
- **Purpose**: The "Wake" state is where integration happens. It is about accepting your physicality and limitations while aligning with the wisdom and creativity from the **Deep** and **Dream**.

### **Interconnection**:

The **Deep**, **Dream**, and **Wake** states are not separate but interconnected:

- **Deep feeds the Dream**: Providing the energetic or intuitive foundation.
- **Dream feeds the Wake**: Infusing creativity and insights into action.
- **Wake reflects the Deep**: Your physical actions and choices can harmonize with your core being.

By aligning these states, you achieve a sense of unity, balance, and purpose—grounding your imagination and intuition into tangible reality while staying connected to your deeper self.
