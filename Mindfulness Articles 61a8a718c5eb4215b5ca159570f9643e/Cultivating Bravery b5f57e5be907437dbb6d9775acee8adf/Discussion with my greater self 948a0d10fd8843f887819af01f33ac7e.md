# Discussion with my greater self

**Greater Self**: "Listen, my dear, to the words of your heart,

A tale of dreams, where you play the main part.

In the theater of life, where your story unfolds,

Be brave, be true, as the future you mold.

---

**You**: "But the dreams I hold, they are vast as the sea,

Can there truly be room for someone like me?"

**Greater Self**: "Oh, brave soul, in life's grand play,

There's room for your dreams, come what may.

Make space in your heart, with resolve and care,

For dreams are like seeds, they grow with the air.

---

**You**: "And what of the times, when fear takes its hold,

When I'm lost in the dark, feeling alone and cold?"

**Greater Self**: "Remember, my child, in the darkest of nights,

Within you burns a flame, a beacon of lights.

Your courage, your hope, are your guiding stars,

Illuminating paths, healing old scars.

---

**Greater Self**: "Be good, be kind, to yourself, to all,

In kindness you'll find, a strength that won't fall.

Your immense dream, it's not just a whim,

It's a promise, a purpose, a beautiful hymn.

---

**You**: "But how can I balance, the now and the dream,

In the rush of the river, the quiet of the stream?"

**Greater Self**: "In each step you take, in each choice you make,

Let your heart lead the way, for your dream's sake.

The now and the dream, they dance in a song,

In harmony they move, together they belong.

---

**Greater Self**: "So, my dear, with courage and grace,

Walk your path, each challenge you'll face.

There's room for your dream, in the vast sky above,

In the land of tomorrow, filled with love.

---

**You**: "I'll be brave, I'll be true, as I journey afar,

For in my heart, I carry a bright, guiding star.

My greater self, I thank you, for showing the way,

In the balance of life, my dreams will sway."
