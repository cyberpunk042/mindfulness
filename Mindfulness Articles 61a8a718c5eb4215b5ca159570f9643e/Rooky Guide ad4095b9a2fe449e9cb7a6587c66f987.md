Mindfulness → Attention control, balance, rhythm
Why be in the rush? more attention in the now mean more time.
Observation and acceptation, of sensations, discomforts.

Aiming for a full spectrum activation.

Unfortunately like many things at first ot might go wrong. A lot… but no matter the amount of failure, keep moving forward.

# Must Know

## **The Power of Meta-Awareness**

**The Concept**: Meta-awareness is the ability to step back and observe your own mental processes.

**The Technique**: Mindfulness meditation.

**The Neuroscience**: Engages the anterior cingulate cortex, which is linked to self-awareness.

**The Example**: Spend 5 minutes or more each day practicing mindfulness meditation to cultivate meta-awareness. 

> You should try to sustain more and more this **awareness over time**

## **The Depth of Meta-Cognition**

**The Concept**: Meta-cognition involves understanding and controlling your own cognitive processes.

**The Technique**: Active questioning and deep internal validation. 
(Long enough pauses between thoughts, holding in the balance of the senses / energy.)

**The Neuroscience**: Engages the prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher-order functions like self-awareness.

**The Example**: Ask yourself, "Why do I feel this way?" and delve deeper into your cognitive processes / thoughts and reflexions.

> You should develop your meta-cognition to make better choice over time

## Cognitive dissonance

- [ ]  revise (draft)

When meta-cognition gets conflicted with meta-awareness.
When cognition, logic forces itself over awareness. (Lesser?)

Becoming detached from sensations rather than accepting.

> Every moment should be one connected to the senses.
Concious and subconcious well and alive.
