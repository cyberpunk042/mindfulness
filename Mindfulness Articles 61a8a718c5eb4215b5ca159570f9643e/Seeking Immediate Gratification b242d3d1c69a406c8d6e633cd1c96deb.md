# Seeking Immediate Gratification

1. **Temporary Satisfaction**: Often, people seek immediate gratification to experience temporary satisfaction or to escape discomfort. This can be due to stress, emotional pain, boredom, or a desire for quick pleasure.
2. **Energy and Motivation**: Resorting to quick fixes can drain energy and motivation that could otherwise be directed towards more fulfilling, long-term goals.
3. **Emotional Avoidance**: Sometimes, immediate gratification is a way to avoid dealing with deeper emotional issues or challenging situations.

### **The Impact on Manifesting Real Goals**

1. **Distraction from Long-Term Goals**: Excessive focus on immediate gratification can distract from and even hinder the achievement of long-term goals.
2. **Diminished Emotional Resources**: When emotional energy is spent on short-lived pleasures, there might be less available for pursuits that require more sustained effort and commitment.

### **Are All Humans Like This?**

1. **Common Human Tendency**: Seeking immediate gratification is a common human tendency. It's part of our evolutionary makeup to seek quick rewards; however, the extent and ways in which people pursue this vary greatly.
2. **Not Just the 'Lost' Ones**: It's not just those who are 'lost' who experience this. People from all walks of life, regardless of their success or stability, can fall into the pattern of seeking temporary gratification.
3. **Individual Differences**: Individual differences in personality, upbringing, life experiences, and current circumstances greatly influence these behaviors. Some may have stronger impulse control or may be more focused on long-term gratification.

### **Conclusion**

Understanding and managing the tendency to seek immediate gratification is a complex and individual process. It involves self-awareness, emotional regulation, and sometimes a reevaluation of one's priorities and goals. While this is a common human trait, how it manifests and is managed varies greatly from person to person. Developing strategies to balance immediate pleasures with long-term goals is a key part of personal growth and fulfillment.
