# My game

My game is called:

```markdown
---------- CE2W ----------
Connect with you body.
Expend into with your mind.
```

A game in which you hold the line repeatedly to stay in flow.

No matter how hard it is, you stay in a rhythm pattern of energy motion.

You aim to enter the Gap, the center from which you feel energy, senses.

Then you browse the body, you browse the spine, elevator of consciousness and you expand mind from there, like opening an eye or an antenna and ready to receive.

You use the notion of 

Wake; ground body, excited particles

Dream; observation, mind over, veil

Deep; flow, play/pause, in between

 

Ever finding your center of gravity.

And holding the senses (gaze?)

Finding comfort (glow?)

Then looking for discomfort.

Browsing the body, the floors of.

In each floor, you find 3 axis, organs.

You sync up with your organs clocks.

You integrate and then you harmonize.

You are looking for a sum that is more you.

By increasing your wake and sustaining the mind and the forward flowing of the spirit.

Increasing the consciousness as the maximum possible stream of energy.

It requires true repeated intention.

It requires a synergetic trio.

ðŸ”† Light beaming from the space to the earth and from the earth to the wake
(To the bones, nerves, cells & organs, always retourning to source))
(Cyling between earth, heaven and source, embrace the struggle.)

Learn to channel the energy. Heal, Power or Induce.

Breathe into the right things. Do not forget while doing deep breathing. (Breath work in general.)
