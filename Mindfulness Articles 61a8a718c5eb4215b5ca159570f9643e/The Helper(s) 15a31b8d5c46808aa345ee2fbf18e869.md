# The Helper(s)

Everyone has one, but it might be turned off, this little voice in the head, ready to help us, guide us.

Sometime this voice seem singular, other times it seem multiplurials, even more harm than good.

> The mind has a helper inside of it, it can either distract you or help you, if you let it. It all depends on you state of mind. If you don't train it it won't listen to you, it won't be yours.
If you let it, it will rules you, if you team up with it you will rule. A good state, good voice(s).
