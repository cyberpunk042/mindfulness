# Perspective of your place as the mind and your capacity as the observer.

[**A Journey Through Electromagnetic Duality and Consciousness**](A%20Journey%20Through%20Electromagnetic%20Duality%20and%20Cons%209f7af56cafd049e68f7808c7274246cf.md) 

This notion is not meant to be understood in one reading but after a long process.

### Mind — Orchestrator & Driver

<aside>
💡 Orchestration is **the coordination and management of multiple systems and/or tools, the orchestrator strings together a whole in order to execute a larger workflow or process**. These workflows and processes can involve multiple systems and often consist of multiple tasks that can handled at once or even automated.

</aside>

**Considering the mind as the whole but also the absense of it first. (Two Sides)**

The mind makes the hold of the models that result in the view of the world / reality.
See it for it’s magnificence, don’t look for flaws but for potentials. (In a true balance)
In the center of all energies, feelings of G (pull and pressure) → The middles of senses.
It is the driver that will get you to the future you can envision, if you suit up repeatedly.
Mind evolve to a complete suit, a complete englobing of the body and systems, it feels itself has the sum of it, of sensations / felt energies. It inject through the center, from top to bottom, expends through the body and into the field and is written from bottom to top, moment present to future X.
Future X cannot be written but only be in fluctuation, and you the sailor toward the future XYZ.
You see the world with a model, from a view, with perspective, and you flow inside in potential.

> Like the action of selecting and connecting together sensations / energies, and then, action of pushing on a complex system, with handles that require a smooth and concentrated touch.
You channel through the system for it to respond, in confidence, in vision of the operation.

Top is the Void, mind comes from void into reality, absorb and contain informations.
Bottom is the information, the mass of unstoppable energy flowing in time. (Reality)
**Mind** comes from the Top over reality and **into the body** which flow from bottom.
Top-to-Bottom is observation and Bottom is the present, & -To-Top is the future.
> 

The orchestrator or director make possibilities and the driver or actor handles them.
The mind learn to flow in directions, tries it and repeat or not; sometimes embed.
Embeded possibilities become a capacity dragged with the self and usable.
See this has the back, third eye, and front, held mass of energy flow.

> Deep down you can understand that Observation is one way
And that energy or “time” naturally flows the other way.
The more observation, the more slowing down time.
> 

Energy naturally flows in time, in a constant iteration.
The mind envelope this mass of flowing energy.
The mind becomes one with it. (Bottom-Up)
Which started from high view. (Top-Down)
Awareness and **Potential**. (Top to Shapes)

That is the art of flow. (Top to motion)
(Influence or flow of energy in time)

### You are

Residing in the energies Gap (Observation) and the **sum**.

You want to find the right pressure. A right **shape**. (& state)

> Exploiting mindfulness and flow and combining it for Mindful & Flow, Mindful Flow.
Which could translate to a great / clear mind & into a great / potent spirit.
Hopefully hosting the spirit in a healthy body that is taken care of.
Healthy mentally and physically for the mind and for the spirit.
That is potentially your main role to drive your life.
> 

Two directions, one top-down and one bottom-up.

### Warning

Fears and stress make you lose Top-Down.

### To Fix?

Reinitiating a moment zero. The Pause.
Gripping in all confidence it’s allright.
There can be a fine outcome to this.

> Things don’t “really matter".
> 

You can overcome the limitations.

Things may matter too much from the bottom-up though, sometimes maybe a little too much which might explain why we “lose” our mind in the process, we fall into a trap and not gain or sustain perspective. Meta-Cognition matter. As much as Meta-Awareness does. Both Together.

> Things don’t really matter is not a plea for hurting the world but for unlocking fears.
As you grow the mind; it does not fear what is to be faced. For a **most capable self**.

When the things matters too much, you may freeze → HAS to stay in the balance.
Sometimes losing sight of the capabilities of the bottom-up in the perspective.
From one side you freeze, time keep flowing and you powerless in influence.
From the other side you react and or run. Bottom-Up into autopilot mode.

Sustaining mind and **spirit**, you won’t do either → calm.
**Stress** and expectations can make it harder for you.
One harder to do and the other harder to be.
Both part of the equation → can’t ignore.
Train both. Master your life. For flow.

### What did he just say??

> I will talk of Mind and Spirit, Mind as the observer, Top-Down, Spirit as the energy, together flowing in hand, Bottom-Up. One could say that spirit is mind but it’s a bit more complex;
Like a battery that can be filled and combined with a system with tracks and processes.
The body is an engine, the mind is the observer and spirit is the sum of current flow.
One intemporal, the other temporal → Spirit as the sum of potential in between.
The mind goes almost nowhere without the spirit and spirit without the mind.
> 

Flow is born from the balanced interaction between mind and spirit. (Top-Down & Bottom-Up)

> You can be a great mind and be respected, but spirits might still not find you attractive.
You can be void of inside, of love, of hope, that’s in the spirit, you have to grow and sustain.
> 

### Summing up the mind

The field of observation, the energy and potential, and the complex motion that navigates all of it.

Your spirit needs a brain (logic), a heart (emotions), and a gut. (feelings? connections? possibilities)
With the respect of rhythm and balance, and the proper supply of hormones and neurotransmitters. 

### Flow and Adrenaline

**Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline) is not something you push, it is something you induce and sails.**

For learning flow, you should understand all I said and how not to hurt your mind & body & spirit.

### Mind expends in the Gap

**Between sense / energy reception and response. In the present, the only place to expend.**

One way to see things; as it expends it can grow in perspective (wideness) or spirit (E potential).

> The observation (field of view over energy in the now) and potential, the injection in the now.
> 

The Gap created in between reception and response, allows for a wider view and higher potential.

This Gap is the mind in the balance, in the balance of energies, of senses, in the view of the reality.

In the present with the dragged models (views / perspectives) and flow-potent toward a new one.

Don’t neglect the mind and don’t neglect the spirit and the balance / oscillation in between them.

💡 **The Driver and The engine → Two Truths to Know and to Accept**
The engine → The body / system to be understood, respected and properly integrated.
The driver → The one that can operate your engine / system conciously / mindfully.
