# Why invest time your time into Mindfulness and Free Will And Mental Models?

- [ ]  Revise (draft)

### Everyone is beautiful (or should be)

Beauty is internal (**it trully is, it is energetic**)

If you cannot look in the mirror and find yourself beautiful, you've got a problem. 
Face it with a grow of awareness, a self generated field of attention, filling and heating you.

> Dancing, stretching, self-coaching, martial arts, mindfulness, awareness, cold, hot, etc.
> 

Find the glow and or source in you that generate this result. It is mind to body. It is possible.

If you feel the void it's fine but if you feel just the void, question yourself? Possibly Limited?

Not dissociated from your body. Pouring Will into each second. Mental AND Physical.

> As you grow / expend the mind in your body, your energy will rise and beauty will too.
There trully is a hearth-brain coherence and a Gut-Brain Axis in yourself. Accept & Respect it.
> 

### Everyone can be a genius

A genius is just a sum of a mind with proper mental model, a given mindset and a level of internal system activation, brains AND organs, with coherence, emotional and hormonal balance.

> Take it from me, I can become the dumbess, near void and yet rise again back to genius level.
Everytime I lose the map, lose coherence or gut, I just do the work again and fix my system.
> 

You have to be ready to take the time though, to rest and recover, accepting all sensations.

### Everyone can be well and happy

First, do no confuse well-being with happiness… Happiness being a state of the mind and well-being the comfort / well-integration of the mind in the body. 

Happiness satisfaction of the reality, a mindset, a perspective, a seeking vs appreciating mind? Practicing gratefulness might sound silly but it is real.. Now what is also real is that practicing it might not force for a mental person due to the nature of forcing / seeking things rather than feeling them. What works in gratefulness is when the many system gets involved and the feeling of it really reside / sit in you. ( As long as you are chasing something, you are not contenting yourself. )
Happiness comes in many levels, the higher the rooler coaster goes, the lower it must be ready to come down.

Wellbeing: health; physical, mental, emotional; & health of the links between those internal systems.
It’s complex but only when you don’t know or don’t accept it. Accept the entirety of it and wellbeing will be fast into a reachable future, bear the current state and sensations and work with it, keep energy flowing as you keep feeling those and soon they become integrated and after they become healed / rejuvanated. (Few things might block you in the road to healing, be prepared.)
Wellbeing comes in many facet of life, each facet helping the others for more overall satisfaction.

### Everyone can be confidence, brave and courageous

It’s just mostly hard to sustain for most of us especially without health and the feeling of success.

> Work on self-identity and self-esteem and you will find it much easier to sustain those traits.
> 

### Everyone can become successful ( in their own sense )

Everyone fails… It’s not about how we fail but how we get up and learn from those failures.

> All about perspective, don’t be the victim, be the hero of your life, one that does not give up.
