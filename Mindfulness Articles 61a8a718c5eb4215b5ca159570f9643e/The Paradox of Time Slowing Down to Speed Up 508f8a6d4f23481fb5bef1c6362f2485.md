## **The Relativity of Time**

Time is not a fixed entity; it's relative and can be experienced differently based on our perspective.

**Coaching Tip**: Understand that your perception of time can be altered. This is the first step in gaining "more time."

## **Time Dilation: A Mindful Approach**

By focusing intently, you can experience what is known as "time dilation," where time seems to slow down.

**Coaching Tip**: Practice mindfulness to enter a state where time feels elongated.

## **The Energy Bubble**

Imagine a dense field of energy around you, like a bubble, that can help you slow down your sensory input and widen your mind.

**Coaching Tip**: Visualize this energy bubble and use it to increase your frequency and boost your system.

## **Mind Boosting Spirit**

When done properly, this focused state can not only slow down time but also boost your spirit.

**Coaching Tip**: Keep your ego in check. The power gained should not go to your head but should be used to boost your spirit.

## **The Backend of Your Mind**

This practice is something only your "backend" mind can achieve, operating behind the bones and through the cells.

**Coaching Tip**: Focus, attention, and concentration are key. The more you practice, the better you get at it.

## **Conclusion**

Time is a paradoxical concept that can be manipulated through focused attention and awareness. By slowing down, you can actually gain more time, boost your spirit, and operate from a place of heightened focus and energy.
