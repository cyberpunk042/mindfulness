# Awaken & Peace with the universe

## Considering this challenge

**Considering that taking the time is always worth.**

- Returning to senses, you know that you can realign your life to the “desired” outcome.
    - “Desired” or rather sought or pursuit. Not to confuse with chasing and obsessions.

Considering what is possible. No matter how impossible it may have seemed at first.

Your love for every being will be defining and / or the reflect of your love for yourself.

- Whole system: Mental - Logical, Physical - Emotional, Intuition - Sensational

Looking for harmony inside for harmony outside and vice versa.

Overcoming anger and frustration, by accepting and bearing..

The love / trust that you have / always can redevelop for children, you can have with anyone, including animals and adults and elders or other races in general. Your kin expend to the whole.

Accept the subconcious side of life and how it apply not just internally but inside the outter world.

Always consider these three important pieces of yourself.

“God”, the observer that was present even before you entered the world.
That was present even before you could comprehend words or communicate.
Already perceiving things from the day 1 of your experience on this planet earth.

“Animal”, the grounded into reality, anchor in the present and source of life.

“Human”, what you grew to become, in between the observer and the animal.
Something virtual that we build ourselves but nontheless quite real like the rest.

God will want pursuit, Animal will want to feel alive and Human will want reason.
If your pursuit is not aligned with your feelings and your reasons, it will not last.

Peace and harmony will trully come when you can be those three as one. Unity.

___

Without god you do no perceive right, without animal you do not feel alive and without human you do not feel right. Harmony trully is born by the balance between internal systems, inside yourself.

### How do you Awaken ? Find the Peace ?

Preparation.

A mindful practice.
A repeated observation.
Repeated senses acceptation.

Find a challenge proper to yourself.
Here is one: [Why I accept pedophilia!?](https://www.notion.so/Why-I-accept-pedophilia-604e8f41bd474febb7467c4332f1aca5?pvs=21) 

Like a performer preparing for a spectacle.
Prepare yourself holistically for the challenge.

It will require you to stay in observation.
It will require to stay grounded. “Kundalini”
It will require you to stay logical / reasoned.

Observation, perception, senses, energy.
Grounded, present, alive, experiencing.
Logical, balance, rhythm, equilibrium.

Only yourself can find you current challenge.
Only yourself can face this/these challenge(s).

By remaining into the “Preparation”, you force yourself to stay focus and phase toward the heigthened concious state required for being / feeling ready to face the eventuallity.

I never said this is going to be easy neither do I say that it will always be hard.

You need to iterate between mental, physical and reasoning till you reach the point of confidence.
In calm, balance and even better if in fortitude. Pain and discomfort is probably innevitable. Good.

Fear is the original driver or the default driver for many of us, living being.
Fear of survival, fear of acceptance, fear of failure, fear of deception, etc…
The mind can free itself from the fears with logic, senses and emotion.

There has to be a layer to the limitation that someone sees that explains their perception of it.
If you can identify this layer, this “thing”, then you can work around to understand the “reason”.

The trick is to focus not mental but mind and body, mental being just a subset of your entirety.
Not losing this awareness and this ground in the now, is the way to reaching the prepared state.

Sometimes when mental, or too mental I should say, you would believe that this state is impossible.
Not limiting yourself to the mental but going for the expansion of mind and body, you can awaken.

**This is the true secret of life. Complete control and lucidity. Peace, awake & beyond ordinary.**
