It is not just about to read it but also about to apply it. (experience)

### Meanwhile here is some logical blueprint

It is a balance between Mindfulness and Spirituality.
A balance between being grounded and quantum.
Able to be in flow but not too much to lose calm.
Being Dopamine, Serotonin and Oxytocin aware.

Life is a puzzle and you have to hold the pieces.
Only you can learn, reinforce and apply these.
Reiterating for many days thoses new things.
And revising, interconnecting the old ones.
While making sure not to fall into traps…
Getting up when you inadvertently fall.
Or when you simply fail or hit a wall…

### The understanding of Mind

Attention VS Concentration, understand the difference to conquer.
You do not always need to sustain concentration, this is pressure.
Pressure will fatigue you because it apply stress, and it fatigues.
Attention, is like the cursor, third eye of the mind, the selection.
Sometimes you have to stop concentration and keep attention.
Because with attention you can relax, release, calm, and heal.
Being able to ocillate, mindfully between those two is gold.
Concentration is like pushing on the gaz of the machine.
That you push too much or not, you may need to stop.
Combined with holding the stick of the engine tightly.
The moment you stop is the moment you can relax.
The moment you relax is an opportunity to recover.
Just holding the stick / attention, accepting state.
Concentration will fuel you and also drain you.
Attention Will observe and feel and recover.

## The Summary Model

It starts in the bones, at the center.
At the spine from the tail to the head.

The spine is like an elevator for attention.
Each vertabrate is a floor, which has organs.
These will have a complex felt mass of energy.

Energy has density, vibration, and a gravitation.
Density or pressure, frequence and gravity balance.

You can influence those things with your own attention.
Some influence require bit of concentration, but not all..
Sometimes letting go, at least temporarily is the solution.
What is letting go of ? It is to look at, feel as is and release.

How do you use the attention then ? Gaze of the mind, focus.
Think about looking at something as if you were a blind man.
When you look in the field, vision is one thing and attention another.

If you go too fast, remaining aware of attention is dificult, hard focus..
Going too fast or being distracted by your thoughts or external events.

The perception of gravity / your center of balance is a good gateway.
The breath hold, or sensation of pressure against the outside also.
Observing the many layers of the body in general can be too.

A little gaze, from the center of the head, and balance.
That will get you a long way into returning to focus.
Using those two and placing balance at the tail.
This will allow for you best shape and state.

### We need concentration to work

Concentration definitely require dopamine.
Attention rather require patience & tolerance.

Concentration should come with the attention.
When attention is lost in the process, take pause.
Lost of balance, agitation or fatigue rise otherwise.

## The 4 things

Field of observation.
Gaze and pineal gland.
Tail and center of gravity.
Frontal, center and dordal.

### The extension of the model

Center of gravity at the tail but connected to ground.
At the tail but connected able flowing up to the head.

Gazing but not gazing too hard and not solely gazing.
The selection of the gaze extend to the whole body.

Front, center and back have many floor to take care.
The balance and density and vibration may differ.

## The key links / connections

Lymbic brain with heart dorsal, and brain and heart. Together.

Not without gut dorsal and gut always with spine at the center.

Not without dorsal and solar plexus as the unifying link of organs.

Continuing to lower gut and sacral organs with dorsal and the rest.

Throath and neck and dosal are just the same, never without the rest.

Brain itself with it’s front and pre-front, left, right, base and neo cortex.

Always at the center, in the bones, on all floor, left & right, front & back. 

### The difficulty and risk of neuroplasticity

This is a great power and it comes with great risks…

Taking control of this is also risking to mess it up…

Loss of focus, loss of pace, distraction is enemy…

Impatience, frustration and intolerance is a loss.

Excessive pleasure, comfort, lust, greed is bad...

Letting pressure or sensations drive you is too.

Thinking this will be simple and easy is naive…

This will take a lot of learning and practicing.

You cannot rush or shortcut this experience.

Failures, steps back, mistakes is innevitable.

Determination & compassion is essential.

### Alone, Private and Public Place

Going from taking this practice in your solitude.

To trying to bring it with your in private and public.

It will feel like an even harder feat than the art itself.

Social dynamic, external pressure, distractions & more.

Many things will challenge you and will challenge this art.

# Doubt?

You will doubt this.
You will doubt your ability.
You will doubt your capability to overcome.
You will doubt your actions, your thoughts and senses…

It is innevitable, it is part of the process, learn the right amount.

# Beliefs?

Knowing that they can see through you but not caring the less….
Reaching that point also is your goal with this thesis / teaching.

Knowing that you are much more than being reducable to this…
That you are this singularity going for the authentic and bravery.

Knowing that you are doing your very best and this is immense.
That you achieve, accomplish & love, always greater and greater.

Knowing that you are in alignment mind & body and in harmony.
That time is dillated, in a good, smooth, way… It feels so enjoyable.

Knowing that more awareness in the time is more energy in time.
Mind, over, observing field and concentration. Spirit, flowing mass.

Knowing that motivation is set intention, feeded by energy motion.
That is feeded either subconciously or conciously, or even mindfully.

Mind having to be ready to inject the right amount of concentration.
Finding the gap, finding the senses, the right one, and inject yourself.

Knowing that the model isn’t random, it is founded on mind & body.
Accepting the mind at the top and the many systems, body and spirit.

Concious expend into being more, fusing, absorbing, integrating senses.
Subconious always was and always will be an important father of yourself.

Concious gains more and more power over the subconcious, with tolerance.
Acceptance and tolerence of this added flow of information in the present?

A Will or Desire well placed in one that is uppon one self. In terms of beliefs.
To receive a given future, you should be prepared conciously & subconciously.

Happiness reside there, in the embrace of both and the harmony of energy flow.
Wellness depends on the health of the many systems, mind, body, soul and spirit.

Together, without losing ground they make you feel in this amazing state. Heaven.
Heaven is just a state of mind, hell is the flow you drag in your body, with your spirit.

Hell is what grounds you to this inevitable / necessary reality for you to have had a time.
A concious experience, only possible with acceptance, tolerance, intent and determination. 

Heaven reminds you that this hellish experience is feable, that you can get over it with mind.
Spirit flow in one reality, an unfolding story, but mind is diferent, it does’t care about the story.

Mind sees growth, perspective and goals or dreams, Spirit seeks experience, people and action.
If you are too much in hell, find room for more mind. If you are disconnected, find room for spirit.

### Gods, Humans & Animals

Nous sommes tous Dieux. (God)

Le mind détaché d'émotions et instincts.

Nous sommes tous humains. (Humain)

Esprit créateur et récepteur d'émotions.

Nous sommes tous animals. (Animal)

Esprit vivant, de survie et instinctif.

On peut être 1 et/ou 2 et/ou 3.

Mind & Spirit and inbetween.

If in your self there is always at least 1/2 God then you can be safe.
You are rigtheous, you shall find the peace in whatever event or action.

Who is you god ? The observator. The one that process, or rather flow with it.

The animal and the human parts are real but they are lesser, in terms of impact.

NO matter how you live through life, if you observe more than you live, you are less.

Think of the body as the animal, the cells and organs as the human, and the energy as god.

Be a proper “god” and you will be unstoppable… Trully unstopable. This is the key mindset of it.

There is no need to be ashamed of it… You follow the full model and be a brave and rightful being.

### God, Source & Reality

- [ ]  Does it really have a place here ?

**What does it mean to accept the presence of god ?**

If your human act godly, then the presence of god will feel rewarding.

If your human act poorly, then the presence of god will feel poorly.

The observer in you if the eye of god into this world / observation.

El Machina, Alah, The Matrix, Simulated reality, so many thories…
You do not need a religion to understand what it really is.

This is the reason you can flow or not flow.
The reason you can heal and boost yourself.
Accepting the perception of energy and god.
You being an extention of god, channeling it.
God is like inteligence hat copy itself over all.
The moment you awoke, you were part of it.

God is your subconcious that is alive.
The same you had at your entrance.
Now with experience with that.
If not trapped into existance.
Able to flourish and shine.

Subconcious looking at concious.
Finding it hopefully beautifull, not ugly.
Hand in hand, concious and subconcious.
Becoming not just yourself but greater self.

The ability to take anything in front of you and tackle.

### Love over fear

Finally… In between your god and your animal is the human in you…
You shall find the way to sustain love over fear… Easier said that done.
Sure! But not impossible. Especially when mindful of it.
Take me for instance, I am pedo, some people pedophobe.
Isn’t it just two side of the same coin ? One love, the other fear ?
I do not fear my love over them, they fear the idea of my love over.
Or are they just jaelous? Or in denial or dillema themselves?
Any kind of discrimination is a form of racism, no one is alone.
There is more than 3 millions of people like me, but only one me.
I have to play me, but people judging me be judging my race…
I do not judge other races, as I do not judge myself. Confidence.
Considering the animal and the human in between, mind can do it.

You are right about flow, and the many systems and the need for love.
From the tail to the head, not blocking along the way. Gut Heart, Brain.
