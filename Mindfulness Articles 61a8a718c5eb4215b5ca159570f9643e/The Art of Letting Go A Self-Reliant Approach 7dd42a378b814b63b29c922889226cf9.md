### **The Power of the Pause**

Pausing is the first step in gaining control over runaway thoughts or emotions. It's akin to hitting the 'stop' button on a machine that's running amok. This pause allows you to step back and observe what's happening without getting caught up in it.

### **Wide and Tolerant Observation**

Once you've paused, the next step is to observe your thoughts and sensations with a wide and tolerant lens. This means not judging or trying to change what you're experiencing but simply acknowledging it. Tolerance here refers to allowing the flow of energy, thoughts, and sensations to pass through you without resistance.

### **Energy Flow and Tolerance**

The concept of energy flow is not just metaphysical but has roots in neuroscience as well. The electrical impulses that flow through our neurons are a form of energy. By tolerating this flow, we're essentially allowing our nervous system to process the experience without interference. This is similar to how electrical energy flows through devices; resistance causes problems, while a smooth flow ensures optimal functioning.

### **Accepting Sensations from Afar**

Imagine observing your thoughts and sensations as if you're sitting on a hilltop, watching them from a distance. This 'height' gives you a broader perspective, making it easier to accept what you're experiencing without getting entangled in it.

### **Practical Steps for a Self-Reliant Approach**

1. **Pause and Breathe**: Whenever you find yourself overwhelmed, take a deep breath and pause whatever you're doing.
2. **Observe**: Use this pause to observe your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Try to do this without judgment.
3. **Tolerate**: Allow these observations to exist without trying to change them. Imagine you're simply allowing energy to flow through you.
4. **Distance**: Try to detach yourself from what you're experiencing. Imagine observing it from a hilltop, gaining a broader perspective.
5. **Accept and Let Go**: Once you've observed and tolerated your experience, you'll find it easier to let go. Accept that the thoughts, emotions, or sensations you've observed are temporary and do not define you.
