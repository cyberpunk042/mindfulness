There is such a thing as the awarenss of the vibration in us.

No matter how debilitating at times‚Ä¶

Being in the Gap come with a reality.

Vibrations in us, around us, over us‚Ä¶
The ociallation between reception and emission.

Logical and Physical and in between for more of life.

Acceptance of the truth of energy and life and our own life.

üí° Become the master of you bladder track and your digestive track‚Ä¶ Through this challenge you shall arise in level of impulse control. Grounded in the wake, receiving in the flow and observing from mind.

</aside>

The best way to stay grounded into the side of mind is to hold digestive track and poop retention muscles attention. (ParaSympathetic ?)

In balance with the hydration, heart and other organs, chemichal track and pee retention muscles attention to hold the side of spirit. (Sympathetic?)

In the middle, nerves and bones. (**Wake** / Cells Excitations / Gates)

Parasympthetic create a ground, a weight going inward into the other side of mind. Sympathetic create a flow outward, into the side of the spirit. One flow to talk and the other use senses.
One is the invisible forces where observation reside and the other is the energy flow, where life is.

You need both because with just life, you have no real awareness of your life and over yourself.
With just mind, reality because with no worth, in fortitude but empty, so both are needed.

There is a dance happening in a day between Parasympathetic and Sympathetic and a balance is to be maintained as one rises in one with the other. An embrace of the father to the child and back.

Only the child trully flow in time energetically but in chaos without the Dad as the source of it.

use the shadow that rise from the bottom and ligth that is summoned from above.
accept that it is about the unlocking of the pineal, top center and bottom center, root.

you have grown a mind and now ‚Äúit is trying to swallow you‚Äù, you have to shadow fight.

you have to keep the light at the top and find the right shape inside body, over your pieces.
