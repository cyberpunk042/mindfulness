# The Quantum / Energetic Self Explained

<aside>
üí° Life will pull you away from this. Just accept to come back when you end up needing it.

</aside>

Do not think of this as mystical or fantastic, this is science, this is reality.
Use the mind & focus. Attention & concentration, through the bones. 

> It is fantastic but not in a fictional way, in a marvellous sense.
Perception of gravity always first. In the balance of energy.
Invest energy into yourself now and intent of the future.
> 

Your attention is primordial for this mission of yours.

**Considering the following image:**

![Untitled](The%20Quantum%20Energetic%20Self%20Explained%20ed7bbf84840747bd924d28b9291aced5/Untitled.png)

On the top-left the notion of inside and outside application to the observation of the mind.
On the bottm-left the notion of the X,Y,Z planes & directions in a 3D environment as the mind.

On the right the notion of around the center, dimension D1, one axiom, D2, second axiom, D3.+
You going from a dot of observation to a 2D shape of observation to a 3D shape of observation.
Navigating the notions of X,Y,Z, dimentional planes discussing on the bottom-left & the top-left.
The top-left, In/Out relating more to the perspective allowing the perception of the X,Y,Z notion.
Over the shape, inside the shape, a shape with a center and a shape that has multiple dimentions.

With all the notions and the strategy depicted at the center of the illustration found at the header;
Consider how one may 1st rise the spirit inside himself with the mind, and 2nd, care for the souls.
Souls with a ‚Äús‚Äù to depict the understanding of the organs or pieces as being distinct when apart.
When disbalance take place or agitation rise & disharmonize leads to the piece being apart.
Soul can still be summed, to the snapshot of your physical body in the present moment.
Spirit is the energy channeled though the physical body, through this physical soul.
For the spirit to rise properly, the system(s) / soul has to be in the right state.
The mind will pour into spirit, inject concentration and it can be used.
Together mind and spirit will thrive if healed or able to heal if not.
In both case the perfect oscillation quite hard, but for the best.
For the best because of how you will feel and be alive.
Never forgeting the mind, and nurturing the spirit.
While always concious of the soul in between.
In between objectives and experience.
Channeling and receiving energy.

### Why is there shapes in the illustration ?

Think of them as overlapping with your body.

The big sphere around being observation.

The upward lines on the side, direction.

The filled sphere being your tail. Start.

The lightning being your head. Exit.

Always grounded, aware of gravity.

Aware of the center of observation.

Aware of the planes and the balance.

Aware of the density and the vibration.

The star support the englobing shield.
The guts connect to void, endless life.
The heart to stay vibrant and radiant.
The cross to link the heart and brain.

A sphere outside yourself you can lean on.
Leaning, in or against this sphere to balance.
The extension of the void but outside yourself.

### The elevator of the mind (anchored)

Anchored inside / coming from your nervous system(s);

Think of your mind as navigating the body through your bones, and you main anchor is the spine and to look at one level which each connect to different pieces / organs you need to move the elevator to the right vertebrate and stay on the level while you look on the floor what is there and you accept to knock on the door and look at the room and keep looking till the chaos / entropy is the room feels right / back in order / in health / in sync with your beat.

Each level being as important as the next, going from the root to the upper spine, limbic brain and brains, always grounded.

Brain being as much an organ as the heart.

Able to hold the two in the same context, and if not, accepting and nurturing till true.

Integrating all levels, one by one if needed.

### **Mindful in balance**

**When you go knock on a door and open the room, receiving senses;
Do so not forgetting the appropriate counter weight / pressure (force).**

To become a force of nature, you need this. Unstoppable flow of life.

Accepting the multidimensions in this illustration / strategy / model.

Learning or fixing and developing, these multiple angles or senses.

It‚Äôs the mind coming from another world, injecting into this one.

The mind channels into this world through senses & influence.

### Just human but knowing

As human we are lost I believe in our place in the world  / reality.

If we can understand the model that interface with it, we can do more.

Accept your condition, accept the model of reality, accept your own destiny.

Denying the truth is just like denying yourself the life closest to your own dreams. 

Do not confuse your energy with the ones of out and keeping moving foward in you.

### Healing  / Alignment / Peace / Balance

In the balance of the attention RAIN and the concentration flow.
You have to be ready to listen to your organs ans stay there when needed.
You have to be ready to accept if something feel not right that it need attention.
That it may need a sustained attention and even Will to face a strong discomfort / pain.
The pain / strong discomfort may be avoidable, but only for it to be avoided / postponed.
Sometimes it will be very long, or even very very very long‚Ä¶ Hours‚Ä¶ but it will be worth it.

Use the technic depicted in the illustration to face every pieces of yourself and every angles.
No matter how long it is you will piece together, even if ever so slightly at least continously.
Till you reach the point when the rain over and the flow trying to go up can do so properly.
It is hard to describe but every piece front and back have their own health and alignment.
In order to be able to contain or keep sustaining the full flow of energy you must fix it.

To stay mindful, to be heartfelt or even heartfull and gut aware or even gutfull, etc‚Ä¶
You have to be able to hold the frame in place and the pieces have to be well.
They have to be well and accessible and you have to able to keep/hold them.

When you hold all the pieces together and hold the frame easy, you are well.

You might have to reconsider your reality and your direction in the process.
You might have to question your mind-body connection and its quality.

### The Problem / Challenge to sustain / retain this / it

A problem with self-gratification is that it may make you deny this.
Over-gratification will hurt it and require a longer / harder work.
Self-gratification will most likely lead to fragmented motivation.
Over-gratification will most likely lead to agitation or suffering.
In both case you might lose feet / ground in the balance of it.
At the edge, of receiving and giving and the pressure around.
*When I say ‚Äúthis‚Äù, I mean this principle, and ‚Äúit‚Äù, your self /soul.*

The issue is not just the self-induced over-satisfaction but the loss of control that might happen.

<aside>
üí° Impulse control is to be taken  into consideration as often the reason of the agitation.
Knowing something is possible, believing it can happen, have it happen & not lose control.

</aside>

# Words

### RAIN

Observation comes first.

Then recognize

Accept & investigate

And finally nurturing.
