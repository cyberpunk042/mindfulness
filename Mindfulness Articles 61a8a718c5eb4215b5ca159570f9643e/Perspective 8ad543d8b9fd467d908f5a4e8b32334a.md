Where is the Light? Everywhere? All Fields?

What is in the middle? A Stretch? A Field?

Can we perceive it all? In balance? Calm?

The field(s) and the field(s) knower. Mind?

Head, Heart, Guts, Groin, Anus, Plexus…

All organs and glands and such still hold true;

A perception of it in the physical through EM Field.

Where is soul? Shapes | structure of flow? (In between the past and the present and the future.

- Structured toward desires, temptation, no more truest path. Always in balance, moderation.
- Making sure that the structure evolving from any state to any state is put rigth with the next.

Doubt will creep you if you give it power through reinforcement; ego or judgement or resistance.
