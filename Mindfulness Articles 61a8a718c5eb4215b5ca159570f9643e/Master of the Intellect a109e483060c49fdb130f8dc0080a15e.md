# Master of the Intellect

<aside>
üí° In honor to all the intellectuals out there..

</aside>

Intellect is hard‚Ä¶ or at least can be or become‚Ä¶

You have to learn to use it and yet not let it trap you.

You have to explore it and yet not use it against you.

You have to find yourself in it and yet not feed EGO.

‚Ä¶

Intelect should be dedicated, or mostly, to interfacing.

To hold the shape, view, context, perspective of things.

When we go deeper or we go too fast, we may get lost.

When we go in not enough humble we might stumble..

When we judge what is flowing in, we might be caught.

Everytime we select something with it, we must let go.

The intelect shouldn‚Äôt lead the way and yet it is still key.

Without this center piece, we can hardly hold the truth.

Learn to use it and learn to pause it and learn to flip off.

Accept to boot it up and accept to empty the loop of it.

The master of the Intellect learn to use it and not be used,

When your intellect is using you for goals, it may kill spirit.

Cuz remember, you are not Intelect, you are the sum with it.

You can make abstraction of the Intellect, with enough space.

With enough relaxation, enough slowing down, clea(r/n) the loop.

It‚Äôs all about accepting Intellect as a process happening in the mind.

You can slow the mind, ground yourself in body and spirit and be free.

Nature is your friend, hot tub is your friend, or physical challenge at times.

It‚Äôs all about leaving the questionning, the analytical, the skeptic, the uncertain.

Instead of embedding those part of you, you look for the love in your heart or more.

You even look for the confidence in your solar plexus or the bravery in your gut & more.

The Atman or whatever you wanna call it, personal god, inner child, can be anywhere in you.

It, you, can be nowhere, anywhere and everywhere. The latter possibly overwhelming at times.

Nowhere to make the void, possibly phasing, moving from anywhere to nowhere to anywhere.

Don‚Äôt think physical for such thing, close your eyes and open your Eye, your third Eye, Attention.

You want to observe things not with Eyes but with sense, with your Observation, skill of attention.

With such a skill you can with determination and patience learn nowhere, anywhere & everywhere.

With it remembering the proper interface you can apply the strategies of your notions and models.

You can learn, train and enforce your perspective, views of life and glue them together in the now.

Instead of having it in constant activation, moving from thought to thought it can hold the puzzle.

Like: [Perspective](Perspective%208ad543d8b9fd467d908f5a4e8b32334a.md), [Breath?](Breath%206edef2d4f208489599679a457e7572da.md)  and [The Quantum / Energetic Self Explained](The%20Quantum%20Energetic%20Self%20Explained%20ed7bbf84840747bd924d28b9291aced5.md) (& the 5th D?)

<aside>
üí° Impulse Control may make a huge difference in the balances of energies.
Pounder it and why it may be so that you build yourself a better idea of it.

</aside>

Be careful of the intellect at times, when mental is high, might pull you to your head for instance.

Concentration might be reached at a moment and then after you cannot ignore the flow that was put in the mind in the intellect, it will not recover itself.

Only you can clear the load with active recovery; relaxation been one thing and recovery another. 

Slowing down and managing pressure is an essential art for learning to play with the intellect fully.

The more intellect you use the more meditation you need most likely.

The more concentration you use with the mind and the more grounding you must do through the body into the Spirit.

Accept the intellect not as a tool to protect futures endlessly or create false visualization but rather for understanding and acceptance and tolerance.

Use it with your heart and find balance, find a way to nurture the focus of intellect and add other pieces to bolster confidence or even bravery, even if just temporarily.

Think of the Intellect as a flexible structure, cords in a background environment in which bounces a part of you, so you don't want to get lost in the bounce before getting to the surface and you don't want it to become entitled and take all the air time.

You want to identify it and it's use and what you should build and hold in it every day.

Only the best notions, not fears or expectations or control; notions that allow you stay above, enter, and leave it and be able to conceive the different facet, pieces that are or can part of your concious self in the now, in the present.

With it you can select and hold or forget and free the bound; don't free the bound and then remain bounded by it, no matter what it, strong or weak, positive or negative, up or down, front or back‚Ä¶

Use mind and intellect to browse your system and yet don't let what you find overwhelm or distabilise or unbalance you..

Hold firm and wisely, focus, no distractions.

Remember in the mind from the intellect, you are the process over the system or branches of the systems, and those systems or branches are only bits.

What you read or receive from them willfully or forcefully, it only is information no matter how weak, strong, smooth or intense, etc‚Ä¶

Don't judge the sensations, develop a mentra, a response pattern of acceptance and tolerance and determination over them.

<aside>
üí° Be careful of excess and exertion. They have an endeniable consequence.

</aside>

The gate from mind to spirit with respect to neurotransmiter and body fatigue weight for the mind..

Dig deeper. If you abuse the power, you will be burned and if you push to hard, you will be drained.

Mindfulness and Conciousness is all a question of the light and the shadow and your focus on them

If you are burned of the light you will lack and if you are void of shadow / inner, then you‚Äôre empty.

The outter veil of attention and observation. The inner energy / filling and flow, actor of the now.

<aside>
üí° When you are someone that care ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, it might be hard being around people in that state. You need repeated attention and active recovery with the mind to heal in time. Focus.

</aside>

<aside>
üïäÔ∏è Don‚Äôt forget the Atman in the balance, it‚Äôs about caring but also not caring‚Ä¶ 1/3 1/3 1/3?
Accepting when there is two side like sensations, receptions, there is a third track. God!?

</aside>

<aside>
üíÄ The problem when we lose track of the Atman, our belief in god is gone and so we suffer.
God not outter to us but God in us but detatched from everything. What we see at death.

</aside>

Mind and spirit in team with body as ground in the middle with respect and balance, & the **Atman**.

In the breath, do not lose yourself at the upper, stuck in pressure, nor stuck on lower / inner of it.!?

Anchored through the spine with the sum connected to the ground and the pressure from above.

A good breath is a deep breath, not a rushed breath, not one we need but a calm and mindful one.

Mindful but like we said before, not overly mind, back to spirit, the Deep, anchored and in Atman‚Ä¶

<aside>
‚öñÔ∏è A balance between parts and an interfacer with interfaces, never to get lost in one and ever rediscovering of them all. But in what order should the balance be established and how?

Backend first? Mind at the back, through the nervous system, on the other side?

Balanced with the Front? through the nervous system, on this side, body & environment

In the middle, the ability to look(or be?) on one side and the other, or the middle.

<aside>
ü¶¥ You must never leave the back ? No matter how tempting?

Never take it for granted, do not stop to stay in there.

There could be no true front without a back.

Sympathy & distraction are foe to the back?
(e.g. a serie in which you lose yourself ‚Üí off)

if you are not able to stay on one side, dance between them finding the center?

then return where needed and be ready for the next dance, and so on.

Accept the tickleling, accept the discomfort, sensations, even pain‚Ä¶

Its hard to always return to the back and remain in there‚Ä¶

Not to get swallowed by the outside, by the others‚Ä¶

But worth the fortitude of mind and self-spirit‚Ä¶

You need a ground, the stronger the better‚Ä¶

</aside>

</aside>

There is a transition, a constant flow from mind to spirit that if mind is not right spirit will not last.
A transition from requiring Willpower to keep the spirit up vs spirit staying naturally up. Focus.

A return to the self, but in the body, all system loaded up, through struggle into harmony.
