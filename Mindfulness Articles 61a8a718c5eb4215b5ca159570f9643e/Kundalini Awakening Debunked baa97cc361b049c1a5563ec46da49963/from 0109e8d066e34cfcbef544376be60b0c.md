Kundalini from root to third eye and crown?

Linked to the soul? The energy that remains

The mind does not control it, it let it flows!?

Is it hard to bear this weight? 

You may want to let go of it?

Stasis / Hibernate & Waves

Give room for it to grow.ww

Is it what allow for you to reach AND sustain; gutful, heartful & mindful?

One growth that stays, a concious alteration that can either enhance or hinder yourself.

Kundalini binds the notions of soul in between mind and spirit? Physical remain.

How not to confuse it with our digesting gut or our heavy heart or tired mental veil?

To be able to stay clear on it and why we sustain it even if it leads to discomfort.

Note that we force it, but that we stay focus on the ever iterating field of observation in which is content the ever flowing spirit, guided by the physical structure/ remain in the now in between of this mind and spirit.v
