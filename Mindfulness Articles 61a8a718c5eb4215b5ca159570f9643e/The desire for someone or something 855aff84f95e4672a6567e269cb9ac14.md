# The desire for someone or something

That will mess you up…

Do it for you.
**live for you**.

> You just have to be ready to do the work, to fix yourself.
> 

No one is asking you to live for them and if they are they are wrong…

That is not what a relationship is… That is dependence and codependence…

Be free, of anyone, of anything, of society, of judgement, of fear, of limitations….

It should be you goal. In all virtue, in your most ethical self, to be who you want to be now.

Like the rush state, spending all your mindfulness or Will on something external is not right.

It is all about what you can control or not and how flowing starts from inside. **Rise the spirit.**

You have an influence in this world but you have to understand it and what you can really do with.

When you get consumed by desire or rush you lose the influence over your reality / your present.

Life can only be enjoyed in the present, not anything else, and full only when healed, then boost.

Understand what mind is and what spirit is to better understand and respect each. Become each.

Understand what is soul and how is it the inbetween image of the mind and the spirit in the now.

Mind is over matter. Mind is into matter. Mind grow into spirit. Mind become alive. Soul rise again.

Attention, positioning focal point, adjusting sphere of observation an listening / receiving information → Accepting and integrating into the sum of perceived energy. E - Balance.

Concentration, squeezing / pressurising / concentrating around a focal attention point.
Conscripting the sphere of obsevation toward the center of the focal attention point.
Injecting flow and potential into sphere or sustaining the flow and / or the potential.

It is more than that isn’t it ? Balance, rhythm, vibration… in / over, front / back…

Concentration can happen spherical and it can happen dimentional. (plane)

> When we say spherical, it is to give it a shape, but the sphere is abstract.
When we say dimentional, we mean, for instance, front against back.
In a similar fashion, top against bottom and left against right.
In the increase of dimentions we reach polygon & sphere.
From 1D, plane, to 3D, sphere, with a different center.
The center of one plane vs another is the colision.
The center of the sphere is the focal point in.

### In falling pray to this vice, “excessif desire”, you will hurt your soul.

Considering that soul is the remaining physical signature of the self. ( Between mind and spirit )
In the alignment of the moment present and the future, the soul will be the glue, the center of it.

Excessif desire, lead to imbalance or agitation on a given plane / field, which hurt your e-signature.

You will then need to heal your soul. Solve any reject, disharmony and agitation and inbalance.

The doing so will require a certain space and mindset. It will require effort and intention.

Effort to tolerance of keeping going, and intention of acceptance and positivity.

> You have to take down the agregate of negative energy inside of you.
And you have to feel and balance the plane of pieces that feel agitated.
Understand how the energy balance feels and find where to tilt toward.
> 

Understand motivation and a fragmented one to understand to avoid to desire.
