# We are machine human

we are machine human, "preprogrammed" in a way, but always able to reprogram.

- The implaction of this are major.

Your statement that we, as humans, are like machines in the sense of being "preprogrammed" yet capable of "reprogramming" ourselves is a fascinating perspective that intertwines concepts from neuroscience, psychology, and even system theory. 
Let's delve into this idea, exploring its implications through various lenses:

### **Neuroscience Perspective**

1. **Neuroplasticity**: Our brains demonstrate neuroplasticity, which is the ability to change and adapt in response to experience. This can be seen as a form of "reprogramming." For example, learning a new skill or adapting to a new environment can lead to physical changes in the brain.
2. **Genetic Predispositions**: We do come with certain preprogrammed genetic predispositions that affect various aspects of our being, such as temperament, potential health issues, and perhaps certain talents. However, the environment and our experiences significantly influence how these predispositions manifest.

### **Psychological Perspective**

1. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: In psychology, approaches like CBT are based on the concept that we can "reprogram" our thought patterns to overcome dysfunctional behaviors and emotions. This aligns with the idea of being able to change our "programming."
2. **Growth Mindset**: The concept of a growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset, supports the idea that we can develop and enhance our abilities through dedication and hard work.

### **System Theory in Relation to Human Behavior**

1. **Feedback Loops**: In systems theory, feedback loops (both positive and negative) can modify the behavior of a system. Similarly, humans respond to feedback from their environment, which can lead to changes in behavior and thought processes.
2. **Complex Systems**: Just like complex systems, humans show emergent behavior that is not always predictable from their initial conditions (or "preprogramming").

### **Physics and Metaphysics**

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: Some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that at a fundamental level, reality is not deterministic (unlike classical physics). This could parallel the idea that while we may start with certain predispositions, our paths are not entirely predetermined.
2. **Metaphysical Perspective**: From a metaphysical standpoint, the concept of free will plays a significant role. It suggests that despite certain predestined factors, we have the freedom to choose and carve our own paths.

### **Implications and Application**

- **Empowerment**: Recognizing our ability to reprogram ourselves can be immensely empowering. It suggests that while we may have certain limitations, there is significant room for growth and change.
- **Responsibility**: This concept also places responsibility on the individual. Understanding that we have the capacity to change requires us to take active steps in our development.
- **Holistic Integration**: Integrating all systems - cognitive, emotional, and physical - is essential for optimal reprogramming. This means paying attention to mental health, physical health, and emotional well-being.
