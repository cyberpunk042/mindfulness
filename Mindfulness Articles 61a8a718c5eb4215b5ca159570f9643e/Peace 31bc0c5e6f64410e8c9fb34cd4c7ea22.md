# Peace

Reaching peace…

We should all be allowed to always reach peace again in a day.

Where the Deep, the Dream and the Wake states are all aligned.

Where the heart in the whole should be incorporated and cared for.

Even better if you can incorporate the guts and the groin and plexus.

When you feel the wake grounded to the fields of gravity from the dream.
When you feel the electromagnetic fields from the dream through the deep.

In the dream is your intellect, injecting into the now, not in control but in the loop.
In the deep the electromagnetic field is unfolding or flowing as you hold the focus.
In the wake you are and you have a current physical state to accept and work with.

Using dream and deep you can discover the wake, together for even more identity.

But, it might adjust to you if you give it time, adapt yourself…
