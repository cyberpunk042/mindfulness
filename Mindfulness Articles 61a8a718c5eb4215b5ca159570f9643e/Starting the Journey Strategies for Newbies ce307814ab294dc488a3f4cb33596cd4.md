# Starting the Journey: Strategies for Newbies

### **Basic Mindfulness Techniques**

Begin with simple mindfulness exercises such as deep breathing, basic meditation, or even mindful walking to lay the foundation for attentional control. These practices will start to build the neural pathways needed for entering a flow state.

### **Positive Affirmations**

Self-doubt can be paralyzing when you're new to mindful flow. Counteract this by employing positive affirmations that you can repeat to yourself in moments of doubt. Statements like "I am capable" or "I am learning and growing" can serve as anchors.

### **Bite-Sized Goals**

The idea of achieving a full flow state might seem daunting. Start with smaller, achievable goals that are still challenging enough to require focus but not so difficult that they induce anxiety. These mini-goals can act as stepping stones to longer periods of flow.

### **Seek External Feedback**

When you're starting, the internal mechanisms for recognizing and maintaining flow may not be well-developed yet. Don't hesitate to seek external validation or feedback to gauge your progress. This can come from mentors, friends, or even professional coaches. Over just external feedback from one end of your mind over the other end, like a second view, a meta-awareness.

### **The Buddy System**

Having a "flow buddy" can offer mutual encouragement and provide a sense of accountability. This can be especially useful for beginners who may struggle with maintaining consistent practices.
A good taking notes and reflections practice can help a lot too when done properly.

### **Self-Compassion for the Novice**

It's easy to become frustrated when things donâ€™t go as planned. In these moments, practice self-compassion. Acknowledge that you are a beginner and that stumbling is part of the learning process.

## **Conclusion for Newbies**

Entering a state of mindful flow can be a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. As someone new to the practice, the initial phases may be fraught with hurdles like self-doubt. However, by employing basic mindfulness techniques, setting achievable goals, and practicing self-compassion, you can begin to lay the groundwork for more advanced flow states. Remember, every master was once a beginner.
