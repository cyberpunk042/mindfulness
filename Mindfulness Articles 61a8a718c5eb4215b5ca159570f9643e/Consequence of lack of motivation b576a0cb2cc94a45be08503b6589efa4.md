It becomes less natural to flow toward your purposes and dreams.

You have to bear the differential weight like in the shaping of the self.

Sometimes to an excruciating pain not to lose the previously acquired self.

You will need about as much tolerance to discomfort has the pleasure you took.

To forge yourself, into being self determinedâ€¦ No more in denial, no more mindless.

Do not seek rest through life disallignement, just take the retreat and feel & calm your pace.

There is always a distribution possible to overcome the current energy / state and balance it.
