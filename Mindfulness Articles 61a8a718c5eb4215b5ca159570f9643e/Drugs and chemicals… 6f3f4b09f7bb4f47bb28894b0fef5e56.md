# Drugs and chemicals…

Drugs are not just pills or weed and such, they are anything that release dopamine in the brain, including food, sex and music. I will not list all the drugs, this is not the purpose of this article.

### What is the issue with drug and the lack of moderation?

The more you consume, the more you need to feel “satisfied”. Such as the gambler who does not need to win anymore to be “satisfied” but just break even, any pleasure works the same, they increase the baseline necessary before you can climb higher and raise the bar even more.

The problem with this is, one getting trap into the hedonic treadmill and two losing perspective on some aspect of your life and health and even possibly well-being and satisfaction in the present.

Drugs will lead you to need more and more of them in order for your mind to expend and stay expended in the body. In the days you do not reach your current baseline / level of “satisfaction”, you will feel the oposite of pleasure, pain (discomfort), and possibly even “unsatisfaction”. It will impact your well-being, may impact your mood and decisions and even your reasoning…

### Why moderation?

It’s simple, moderation is a way to not say no to pleasure but rather create a baseline that make sense and is sustainable. It’s a way for you to stay in control of yourself and not driven by pleasure.

### Why pleasure if not true satisfaction?

What we refer as pleasure is often actually dopamine, dopamine is one of four main types of chemicals that drive us as the mind; **dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.**
Satisfaction does not come from dopamine but rather serotonin which mainly come from the Guts.
Like I said dopamine is pleasure and pleasure is not satisfaction, dopamine is a way to seek, it’s a way to reward our brain for goals and good actions and such. Like a reward candy to train us.
Oxytocin is the love hormone, it’s play is hard for me to explain but it is an important part.
True and complete satisfaction comes from a balance of Serotonin, Dopamine and Oxytocin.
Add endorphins to the mix and you have an even better mixture if you respect the equilibrium.

### Why satisfaction / well-being is not happiness

Happiness is a state of mind, it require a psychological and maybe philosophical understanding to pursue. But in truth happiness is simple when we don’t make it complex. It comes to us when we stop to seek things and enter a certain mindset. well-being is not the mindset but rather how well and injected we are as the mind within the body. Seeking too much pleasure, you will temporarely feel an increase of happiness, just to make you feel unhappy as you get farther from the baseline.

### What does this all mean?

Drug is a hack, a cheat code to make us think we are feeling better than we actually feel or enhance the present moment or a given experience. Once out of the hack we might have to face backlash.
Understand the source of serotonin, oxytocin and natural dopamine for a better balance of life.
