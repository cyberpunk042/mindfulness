# Holisticfulness

Dig the idea of not just mindfulness but heartfulness and gutfulness. 
Giving birth to and sustaining a greater soul and spirit!?

Soul and soulmate (s) goes together. ðŸ’ž â†’ Hurt ? lol ? Tolerance ?

Where does faithful fit in that too? â†’ What a great questionâ€¦

Hopeful and faithful and sustained? â†’ Living heaven ? Peace ?

One of the risk is thinking that outside things will fill you when in reality only you can feel yourself to attract things from the outside into your life, otherwise be void and have void, be full and have the reflect of your summoned potential and applied mindfulness.

What is filling yourself??? Time & attention. 
Looking inside and holding mind over sphere and into/inner expansion.
