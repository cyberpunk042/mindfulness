Commitments are hard when pleasures or even obsession get in the way. Might explain the rupture of certain realities?

Without commitment mind lose the north?

Relate to losing hope, one way or the other.

Or lost of interest, fragmented motivation.

**The Power of Choice and Self-Determination:**
The belief in our ability to influence our life’s direction is at the heart of self-determination theory. Neuroscience suggests that exercising choice and autonomy strengthens neural pathways associated with positive emotions and motivation. Embracing this power of choice empowers us to shape our identities and futures, moving beyond the constraints of our past and present circumstances.

**Commitment vs. Pleasure and Obsession:**
Commitment to long-term goals often battles with the lure of immediate pleasure or deep-rooted obsessions. This conflict can lead to a rupture in our reality, as dopamine-driven pleasure-seeking behaviors can overshadow our higher goals. Understanding and regulating these impulses through mindful decision-making and goal setting can help maintain focus and commitment.
