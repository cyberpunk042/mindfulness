# The trap of unreadiness

Because sometimes we fail to be fully prepared and throw ourself in the worldâ€¦

Not without having repercussionsâ€¦ Readiness and being prepared is goldâ€¦

The trap of going to an event, to a scene, not readyâ€¦ Without realizingâ€¦ Not properly filled, not dilated in time like spirits usually are, maybe hard to bear for people. ðŸ˜–
Doing our best to stay true to ourselves but it is more than that.
Itâ€™s about an amount of frame of observation per second I say.
You get to the point that you have no fear that there can be.
Gut, Heart, Brainâ€¦ All of it. Why was it not even there ?
Didnâ€™t fully expend and sustain from the morning ?

How do we do that ? Enough Dopamine ???? â†’ Donâ€™t be too much in a hurry and remember to enjoy baka 

We forget important things?

Puposes??? Love? â†’ We do not take the time to properly get them back in. (Disbelief â†’ Loss of hope) â†’ Hard to hope repeatedly when you have failed, can become so so hard. â†’ We have to fill ourself, push on the pedal that fills the field of observation from the focal point !? Like a grip on a handle. â†’ We are getting there. I swearâ€¦ I AM GETTING TO IT.
