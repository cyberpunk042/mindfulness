# Why you should avoid chronic stress

Chronic stress can have a detrimental impact on your body's biochemistry, including the balance of neurotransmitters and hormones. Elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol can lead to a variety of health issues, such as:

1. **Mental Health**: Increased cortisol levels can contribute to anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders.
2. **Digestive Issues**: Stress can negatively affect your gut health, leading to issues like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and indigestion.
3. **Immune System**: Chronic stress weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections.
4. **Heart Health**: Elevated cortisol levels can lead to high blood pressure and increased risk of heart disease.
5. **Weight Gain**: Stress can lead to unhealthy eating habits and weight gain, further exacerbating health issues.
6. **Disrupted Sleep**: High cortisol levels can interfere with your sleep patterns, leading to insomnia or poor-quality sleep.
7. **Reduced Cognitive Function**: Chronic stress can impair memory and cognitive function over time.
8. **Emotional Imbalance**: Stress can make it difficult to regulate emotions, making you more reactive and less able to engage in mindful practices.
9. **Pain Sensitivity**: Elevated cortisol levels can increase your perception of pain, making it more challenging to be in a state of mindful flow.
10. **Reduced Creativity and Focus**: Stress can hamper your ability to think creatively and focus, making it difficult to enter a state of flow.

Chronic stress can make it "painful to be alive" in a sense, both physically and emotionally. It's crucial to manage stress effectively to maintain a balanced internal biochemistry and to be able to enter and sustain states of mindful flow.
