# Locomotion

Mindfulness can be thought of as a *locomotion*—a continuous, purposeful movement of attention. It isn’t a static state but a dynamic action that keeps your awareness grounded in the present moment. By “keeping it in place,” you’re choosing, again and again, to bring your focus back to *what is* instead of letting it drift unconsciously.

This constant, active engagement is what gives mindfulness its power: even as thoughts and stimuli come and go, your steady practice of “moving” awareness back to center enables calm, clarity, and balance.
