# How to Enter the Gap

### **How to Enter the Gap:**

1. **Awareness**: The first step is to become aware that you're having an emotional reaction. This could be noticing a physical sensation (like a racing heart), a thought, or an emotional feeling.
2. **Stop**: Literally stop what you're doing. This could mean stopping mid-sentence, putting down what you're holding, or simply freezing your train of thought.
3. **Breathe**: Take deep, slow breaths. This has a calming effect on the nervous system and helps engage the prefrontal cortex.
4. **Observe**: Use this time to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This is the essence of mindfulness.
5. **Decide**: After this brief pause, make a conscious decision about how you want to respond to the situation.
