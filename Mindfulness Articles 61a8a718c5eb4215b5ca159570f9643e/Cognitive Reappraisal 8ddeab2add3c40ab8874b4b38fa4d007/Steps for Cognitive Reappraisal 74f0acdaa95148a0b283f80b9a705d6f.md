# Steps for Cognitive Reappraisal

### **Steps for Cognitive Reappraisal:**

1. **Identify the Trigger**: Recognize the situation or thought that is causing an emotional response. The first step is awareness.
2. **Pause and Breathe**: Before reacting, take a few deep breaths. This gives your prefrontal cortex (the rational part of your brain) time to catch up with your emotional response.
3. **Assess Your Initial Interpretation**: What are the thoughts going through your mind? Are they factual, or are they based on assumptions or biases?
4. **Challenge Your Thoughts**: Ask yourself questions like:
    - Is this thought based on evidence?
    - Are there alternative explanations?
    - What would I tell a friend who had this thought?
5. **Reframe the Situation**: Based on your answers, come up with a more balanced or positive interpretation of the situation. For example, instead of thinking "I failed, so I'm a failure," you could reframe it as "I didn't succeed this time, but failure is a part of the learning process."
6. **Evaluate Emotional Shift**: After reframing, check in with yourself. Has your emotional state changed? Do you feel more balanced or less reactive?
7. **Apply the New Frame**: Going forward, use this new interpretation as your mental frame of reference for similar situations.

### **Example:**

- **Trigger**: Your project at work didn't go as planned.
- **Initial Thought**: "I'm terrible at my job."
- **Reframe**: "Not every project will be a success, and that's okay. This is an opportunity to learn and improve."

By practicing cognitive reappraisal regularly, you can train your brain to default to more balanced and constructive thought patterns, thereby building emotional resilience.
