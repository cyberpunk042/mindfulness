# Self & Reality

You have a front / spirit & reality / sums of energies (self / inward and reality / outer) and you have a backdrop (shadow), mind / awareness and observation and perception.

Mind goes in over spirit and into outer / reality in time (energy flowing in relativity from present to next present)

Not only the concept but the respect of the knowledge and the sums are important.

It doesn't matter what you are as of now â†’ we can choose what we are into becoming.

We always can or can at least return to it
