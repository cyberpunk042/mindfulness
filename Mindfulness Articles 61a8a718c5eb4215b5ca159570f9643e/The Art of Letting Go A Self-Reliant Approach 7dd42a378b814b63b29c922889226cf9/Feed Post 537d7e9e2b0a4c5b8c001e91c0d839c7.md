2️⃣ **Observe** 👁️: Use this pause to notice your thoughts and feelings. No judgment, just awareness.

3️⃣ **Tolerate** 🌊: Let the energy flow. Imagine your thoughts and emotions as waves passing through you.

4️⃣ **Distance** 🏞️: Detach and observe from a 'hilltop.' Gain a broader perspective.

5️⃣ **Accept and Let Go** 🎈: These experiences are temporary. They don't define you. Let them go.

🌈 Empower yourself by mastering the art of letting go. It's a journey of mindful awareness and self-regulation. 🌈
