# Analysis of thoughts

latest description to understand your experience and how it relates to your goal of returning to a state of calm idleness:

1. **"Really to return to just be idle, just be able to be idle, unneedy of a next thought"**:
    - Here, expressing a desire to reach a state of true idleness, where your mind isn't actively seeking the next thought or stimulus. It's about being content in the moment without the need for mental activity or progression.
2. **"Remembering that most of it is about the shape of your observation and that you have to remain in the pause"**:
    - This emphasizes the importance of how you observe your thoughts and experiences. Staying in the pause suggests a mindful awareness that is observant but not reactive. It's about noticing your thoughts and sensations without getting caught up in them.
3. **"Repeatedly try to send yourself in the pause, in the backseat of your mind"**:
    - Suggesting a technique of continually reminding yourself to step back mentally, to take the 'backseat.' This means observing your thoughts and feelings from a distance, rather than being in the driver's seat, actively engaging with them.
4. **"Re-realizing that you can stop the flow of thoughts and that it is mostly about observation"**:
    - This points to the realization that you have the ability to interrupt the continuous flow of thoughts. It underscores that your practice is more about observation rather than getting involved in the content of your thoughts.
5. **"Reflection, the evolving through the sense of your current perception is not thinking (flow of thoughts/words)"**:
    - Distinguish between reflection and thinking. Reflection here seems to be more about evolving your perception and awareness, a process that goes beyond the typical flow of thoughts and words.
6. **"Thoughts and word are mental and mind is not mental, mind is in the gap, not needy of mental, just idle in energy"**:
    - This is a profound insight where we differentiate between 'mental' activities (like thoughts and words) and the essence of the mind itself. We describe the mind as existing in a 'gap' â€“ a space beyond active mental processing, where it can remain idle in energy.
7. **"If not aiming to be returning to meditation and allowing for stillness if agitated and allowing itself the pause to look at its stillness"**:
    - Here, suggesting that if the goal is the focus should be on allowing mind to be in the balance, with stillness, especially when agitated, returning to the sum and the center and allowing / giving yourself permission to pause and observe the stillness of your mind.

In summary, this perspective emphasizes the importance of a mindful, observant state where you're not actively engaging with or pursuing thoughts. It's about realizing the capacity to be in a state of mental idleness, observing your mind from a distance, and understanding the difference between active thinking and the more passive, observant nature of the mind. This approach aligns with your goal of returning to a sense of calm and idleness while maintaining a vibrant connection to life.
