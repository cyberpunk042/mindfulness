# Know to better overcome yours

We all have issues, or glitches or pitfalls that watches us…

Sometimes it is a recurent challenge, a recurrent problem, an infinite loop we go through…

The best way to prepare ourself and overcome those issues is to know them in great depth.

Here is an example of issues / pitfalls / gltiches:

As the writter of this, I am who I am and **you are who you are**.
We have similarities but probably don’t have the same main flaws.
Work to find and identify properly yours and to gain understanding.

The more you **understand those glitches**, the better you can face them.
**Break them down**, search about them, ask GPT or experts and memorize.
Don’t just understand them, build a strategy to beat or recover from them.

The sooner you observe them and gain perspective the sooner you win a fight.
Maybe winning a fight is not winning the war, but it sure as hell is a good start.
Keep at it and one day you might just be able to laugh about those silly issues.
