# Self realization

Masturbation can causes downtime, this is why you “cannot” or shouldn’t do much and especially excessive.. Moderation for reason and abstinence to lives. Everything is fine but if you want to manifest more, have room for more, you should focus. Otherwise you are hindering your capacity for other things... You are making yourself not ready at any time, not enough rested or bored enough.

You cannot anticipate how hard it will be for you to stay awake and mindful after it.

You cannot talk for your future self when you stay a long time on the edge and think that you will be fine with the consequences.
