# Rush happens with anything

It can be work. It can be a task. It can be goal in general, we get impatient to get to the end of it.. 

### For / because of what?

Hard to explain sometimes.. it remains a glitch, one closely related to the reward system.
I am not saying to use this as a excuse but be compationate and learn to identify it.

Sometime we will reach a point and we will seek something new…
It may be to meet new people, it may be to have intercourse….
It may also be very much mundane like doing the dishes…

This flaw can happen at any time.
Understanding what drives it is key.

We lose ourselves “TOO MUCH” in the process.

Because is i not about not fusing with your actions…
But it certainly is about remaining in control of them…

Balance, Calm, Patience… When you lose those things…
Well it is a sad news for yourself and the world in a sense.
