# Be your self Dad (doer) and self Mom (caring)

Dad will watch over your progress and Mom will **watch over** Dadâ€™s **filling**.

One will provide challenge and growth and the other **feeds and supply**.

Two system, with two very different approach, **Feminine** and Masculine.

Call them what you want, they are both part of you. **Soft** and Thick.

One that you want **full** and the over that you want driven.

The Driver must fuse with the Tank and vice-versa.

Yes, yes, **Mom is Tank** and Dad is Driver baby!!!

> Be Mom and Dad, be **kind and strong**.
> 

Sure you can be fed by an external female
and you can be driven by an external male
But embedded in yourself is much greater.
