# The Neuroscientific and Psychological Underpinnings of the 'Chasing' Trap

## **Introduction**

Many of us often find ourselves "chasing" after goals, desires, or even people, only to feel unfulfilled and drained. The question is, why do we fall into this trap? Using neuroscience and coaching perspectives, this article aims to unpack the allure of chasing and why it often leads to dissatisfaction.

## **The Instant Gratification Trap**

### **Dopamine Spikes**

Our brains are wired for instant gratification, releasing quick bursts of dopamine in response to perceived rewards. This system, however, is a double-edged sword; it can lead to a "chasing" mentality focused on short-term gains.

### **Emotional Hijacking**

In a state of chase, the amygdala—our emotional control center—often overrides the logical prefrontal cortex. This 'emotional hijacking' can lead to impulsive behaviors and uncalculated risks.

## **The Obsession Loop**

### **The Role of Cortisol**

Chasing something obsessively activates stress hormones like cortisol, which, ironically, diminish our cognitive capabilities and narrow our focus. This creates a loop where the more we chase, the less able we are to achieve our objective or even to re-evaluate it.

## **Chasing as a Cultural Construct**

Society often romanticizes the notion of "chasing" your dreams, promoting a mindset that overlooks the benefits of balanced, strategic pursuit. Coaching methodologies strive to break this cultural programming by introducing structured goal-setting.

## **Coaching: The Circuit Breaker**

### **Reframing Perspective**

Coaching interventions aim to reframe your perspective, making you aware of the futility of chasing and helping you adopt methods that are more in line with sustained, healthy engagement and fulfillment.

### **Breaking the Loop with Feedback**

One of the essential tools in coaching is regular feedback. By assessing your actions and their consequences, you're better equipped to break the chasing cycle.

## **Conclusion**

The allure of chasing is deeply rooted in both our neurobiology and societal narratives. However, awareness of these influences and a shift towards strategies backed by neuroscience and coaching can transform this counterproductive behavior into purposeful, satisfying pursuit.
