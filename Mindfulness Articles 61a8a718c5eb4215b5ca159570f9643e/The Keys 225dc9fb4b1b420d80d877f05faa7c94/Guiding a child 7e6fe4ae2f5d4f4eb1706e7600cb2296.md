# Guiding a child

**Hello there! Let's talk about something really special and magical â€“ it's called being aware and growing up inside, just like a little seed grows into a big, strong tree.**

1. **Your Special Light Inside**:
    - Imagine you have a tiny, sparkly light inside you, right at the bottom of your tummy. This light is super special â€“ it's like your own little sun! Sometimes, when you feel happy or really peaceful, this light starts to shine brighter and move up and up, all the way to the top of your head.
2. **Listening to Your Heart and Tummy**:
    - You know how sometimes you feel things in your tummy or your heart? Like when you're super excited or when you love someone a lot? That's part of growing up inside. It's important to listen to these feelings because they help you understand yourself better.
3. **Being a Super Observer**:
    - Have you ever played a game where you watch things carefully? It's like being a detective! You can do this with your own thoughts and feelings too. Just sit quietly, close your eyes, and notice what's happening inside you. It's like watching clouds in the sky!
4. **Breathing Like a Happy Whale**:
    - Breathing is a superpower! Try this: Take a deep breath in, hold it for a tiny bit, and then let it out slowly. Imagine you're a happy whale, blowing water out of your spout. This helps your special light move and makes you feel calm and strong.
5. **Dance and Wiggle to Happy Music**:
    - Music is like magic for your heart and light. Put on your favorite songs and dance around! Wiggle, jump, and spin! It's a fun way to let your light shine.
6. **Finding Fun in Everything**:
    - Remember, everything you do can be fun, like a game. Whether you're learning something new, helping around the house, or playing with friends, always look for the fun and happiness in it.
7. **Resting Like a Cozy Bear**:
    - Even superheroes need to rest! After a day full of adventures and fun, give yourself a big, cozy hug and rest. This helps your light get ready for another day of shining bright.

**Remember, you're amazing just the way you are, and every day is a chance to let your special light shine brighter and make the world a happier place!** ðŸŒŸðŸŒˆðŸ’–
