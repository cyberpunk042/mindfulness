# Love, Faith & Attachment

Get attached to things and start to think that you need them and then be forced to realize that this dependency is a bad thing.

**Love and faith isn't need and dependency**.

The whole can only be found / induced BY YOU and inside yourself, not metaphorically but rather, magnetically and physiologically.

To be a brave and sustain all day, every day.
