We are machine and I am gonna fix you.
If you didn't have the right model or not, dare look at mine.
If you don't find truths, answers, about you, I would be surprised.

You do not need a religion, you just need your own self version with a mental model.
With the rigth models, you will sure find a way to achieve it all, just anything ultimately.
But you need to understand the whole / complex system, for the optimal and the sustained self.

It is a model that allow you to detach from any fears and limitations, by complete understanding.
You mental cannot reject the sum of your energy through your body, your hormones, you chose it.
Realize that you have put the stress or excitation there and that there can be a great perspective.

Living for fun and for happiness, not seeking anything, accepting body and sensation and the mind.
