# Charge Up and Down

If the proper art of mindfulness, meditation, recreation and contemplation is a way to charge up.

Working toward goals and especially hunting / chasing and sex and porn, is a way to charge down.

### Two sides and two directions (soul in between)

One has the purpose to nourish the spirit from the mind.

The other consume the spirit to feed the mind.

Mind without spirit and vice-versa is bad.

Moderation and balance is key to this.

### It’s important to understand the notion

It can be useful to put into practice.

Don’t go past the up you can tolerate.

Don’t go past the down into exhausted.

Over what you can tellerate and on the edge.

Lower than your baseline and you feel like crap.

Your life cannot lead to the void…

Living in the moment is fine…

Falling pray to rush is vice…
