# Contemplation, lust & pleasure

- [ ]  Work on it & backlinks

There is a difference between contemplation and lust, but sometimes we fail to see it, we forget in the attraction of things that it is not about desiring anything but merely appreciating without the need. (Impact on the soul?)

How and when does this happen to us? That we go for love and end up for sex? Good question… we think it won't matter.. we fail to realize the importance of this… unwell or tired we don't see and we seek.

But it stops at some point doesn't it?

Yes, but…

Do we have the problem of seeking things and the problem of excessive gratification.

In certain situations we resort to it because? Feeling satisfied… tmp?

Then we don't have the energy or motivation or emotional supply to deal with the real things that can manifest real

Not about removing all temptations but about have it near but resisting it, still..

### **Understanding the Shift from Contemplation to Lust**

1. **Biological Factors**: Human beings are biologically wired to seek pleasure, including sexual pleasure. Lust can be a natural, instinctual response to certain stimuli.
2. **Emotional State**: Emotional vulnerabilities, like feeling unwell, tired, or stressed, can sometimes lead us to seek immediate comfort or escape. This can manifest as pursuing physical gratification instead of deeper emotional connections.
3. **Societal Influences**: Society and media often glorify physical attraction and sexual conquest, which can blur the line between seeking meaningful connections and pursuing physical satisfaction.
4. **Personal Needs and Desires**: Sometimes, personal needs or desires for intimacy and closeness can be misinterpreted or redirected towards physical attraction and action.

### **When and How It Happens**

1. **In the Heat of the Moment**: In moments of strong attraction or emotional intensity, it's easy to act on impulse rather than contemplating the deeper aspects of a relationship.
2. **Misinterpreting Feelings**: It's not uncommon to misinterpret feelings of love and emotional connection as purely physical desire, especially in the early stages of a relationship.
3. **Seeking Validation or Comfort**: At times, individuals might turn to physical intimacy as a way to seek validation, comfort, or to fill an emotional void, confusing it with love or deeper connection.

### **The Realization and Its Aftermath**

1. **Self-Awareness**: Over time, individuals may develop greater self-awareness and realize that their pursuit of physical pleasure isn't fulfilling their deeper emotional or spiritual needs.
2. **Maturity and Growth**: With maturity and personal growth, there often comes an understanding of the difference between physical desire and a more contemplative appreciation of love and connection.
3. **Realigning Priorities**: This realization can lead to a realignment of priorities, where one seeks more meaningful, emotionally fulfilling relationships rather than fleeting physical encounters.

### **Conclusion**

The journey from understanding the difference between lust and a more contemplative love is a part of personal growth and self-discovery. Recognizing and respecting this distinction is crucial for developing deeper, more fulfilling relationships and for personal well-being. As individuals evolve, they often find that true satisfaction comes from connections that satisfy not just physical desires, but emotional and spiritual needs as well.
