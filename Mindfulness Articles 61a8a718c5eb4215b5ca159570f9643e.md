(The true journey is to tap into your subconcious and expend your reach?)

And then integrate and sustain and repeat, and repeat, and repeat, ahahaha üòÄ

(Find the drive to pursue constant mindful flow: With the help of this model)

Keep your gut, heart, brain, in and bones & nervous systems over: balanced (what ? XD ) thick layer over the soft inside that comes naturally ? Breath and connected with mind over it and holding it.

### Advanced table of content and the chain of information

Three way for you from here. You can either start at one page and follow the chain of information using the subpages or links to other sections / pages of the site. You can also take a look at the ‚Äú**Advanced table of content**‚Äù and click randomly or on an article that resonates with you. And the third option is to just do your own research, ask your own question, to yourself and to the internet.
In any ways I encourage you to re-read, re-think, and re-practice. Fully injested and fully digested.

(make sure the gut is encompased, 80-90% source of serotonin. When you have been disconnected for along time it might seems like a mountain to get back into it and repeatedly day after day? The day after of you lose your 80-90% you feel life is hard insurmontable, but if you wait long enough, attentive to it and patient long enough, then in that new day again you receive the 80-90%!? Repeat til it rebecome more natural?) ‚Üí no more need of drugs after that, it's the ‚Äúlong‚Äù route compared to drugs but one that does not depend on external factors and that is more sustainable and nourishing!? Especially in the long run. Worth every moment of pain / discomfort!? How long though? 1-2-4 or even 5-6 hours sometimes? Faster with tricks like heat and cold therapy? But can you really do this trick every day!? There really is a true satisfaction, an unbeatable one that lays there. When it's fully on, sustaining is so much easier‚Ä¶ NOT TO NEGLECT It though.

Serotonin feed the spirit which feeds all the rest? Compared to dopamine that feeds mostly the brain and nervous system? (sympathetic and parasympathetic ?) 

One about how fear and or stress and or anxiety might froze you or even create cognitive dissonance.. it might turn you in fight or flight and stop the flow of you mind.

What do you do? You practice, you stay mindful, you observe it happening, you try no to overthink but rather observe, deep breath, relax and reground yourself in the body, you try to remove the fear to rationalize during if can or at least afterwards and on paper if necessary.

We all have our challenge, we all have our fears or trauma, often self induced due to the nature of the mind and the play of perspective in the matter. We have our own imagination and our own projection of outcome. Fear will sease you, ot will rub you of you mean and you wellness, it will disrupt the mind and the flow of energy, you will learn to re-relax and stay soft, stay fluid.

An article, mind vs body vs spirit, to understand and the parallel of attention and energy flow and information/sensation and compex energy motion from body/emotion?
